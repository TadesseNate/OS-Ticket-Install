<h1>osTicket - Prerequisites and Installation<h1> 
In this lab, I install osTicket from the ground up using the necessary installation files. There are a few steps to take before the installation of the ticketing system. This lab is done using a Windows 10 Pro VM made on Azure.
<br />

<h2>Environment and Technologies Used</h2>

- <b>Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines)</b> 
- <b>Remote Desktop Connection</b>
- <b>Internet Information Services (IIS)</b>
- <b>MySQL)</b>

<h2>Environment and Technologies Used</h2>

- <b>Windows 10 Pro</b> 

<h2>Installation Steps</h2>

Before installing any files, Internet Information Services (IIS) needs to be enabled. We are installing osTicket locally and it needs IIS in order to function. To turn on IIS, open the Control Panel. From the Control Panel, open Programs and and Turn Windows Features On or Off. Within this menu, expand Internet Information Services, expand Web Management Tools and enable IIS Management Console. Click and expand World Wide Web Services and expand Application Development Features. In Application Development Features, enable CGI and click ok to confirm.

![iis](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c48c067-9e9f-48bb-a31e-e3011c0c9524)

After enabling IIS, download and install PHP Manager for IIS (PHPManagerforIIS_V1.5.0.msi) from the installtion files folder. Download and install the Rewrite Module (rewrite_amd64_en-US.msi) after installing PHP Manager for IIS.

![iis2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/facec482-6708-460d-93f1-83a93afd6be2)

After installing the Rewrite Module, create a new folder/directory called C:\PHP on the Windows (C:) drive. This new folder will be used to unzip the contents from the PHP 7.3.8 (php-7.3.8-nts-Win32-VC15-x86.zip) zip folder downloaded from the installation files. Extract all contents from the zip folder into the C:\PHP folder.

![cphp](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bef6430d-93e8-4fa1-b5b0-b0008d461856)

Next, download and install VC_redist.x86.exe from the installation files.

![redist](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65de48e2-3124-4fa0-897c-eb88106d3f61)

Next, download and install MySQL 5.5.62 (mysql-5.5.62-win32.msi) from the installation files. Within the MySQL setup wizard, click "I agree" and select a Typical install and Install. Launch the Configuration Wizard after the installation. Select Standard Configuration and select Install As Windows Service and make sure Launch the MySQL Server automatically is checked. For credentials, the username will be root and the password is Password1. In a practical setting, the credentials will be basic to where they can be easily guessed. For the purposes of this lab, the standard credentials root and Password1 will do.

![mysql](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bbc1b0c-c9a8-4825-a6bb-8b07efa967a8)

Before installing osTicket, configurations need to be made within IIS. Open IIS as an admin and select PHP Manager. Within PHP Manager, select Register new PHP version. Select Browse and select the PHP CGI executable file (php-cgi.exe) within the PHP folder created earlier in the lab. After registering the PHP version, reload the IIS server within the management console.

![php](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c553778c-7226-4ec8-849d-180b3dd1b3cc)
![php2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48cc091d-be7f-4985-a24e-6f8110a1416c)

From the installation files, download osTicket v1.15.8. Extract and copy the "upload" folder to the following path: c:\inetpub\wwwroot. Within the c:\inetpub\wwwroot folder, rename "upload" to "osTicket." Reload the IIS server afterwards.

![wwwroot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a4be366-b230-481c-be4c-172d6851601f)

Within the IIS console, browse to Sites -> Default -> osTicket. Click "Browse *:80" and the installation page for osTicket will now show up. Some extensions are not enabled and they will be enabled with the IIS console before installing osTicket. To do so, click on PHP Manager while in the osTicket menu in IIS. Click on "Enable or disable an extension." Enable the following extentions: php_imap.dll, php_intl.dll, php_opcache.dll.

![install1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/796a96c1-578b-4045-ad6f-2bcbb3d91533)
![install2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5bf62574-0e8e-40db-bed3-9f1f0ff6ac26)
![install3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db4eed66-4fe3-44fc-a6ac-92ec5df0289e)

Before continuing to install osTicket, a file needs to be renamed as well as have its permissions changed. From C:\inetpub\wwwroot\osTicket\include, rename ost-sampleconfig.php to ost-config.php. The newly named ost-config.php will have its permissions changed. Open its Properties and change the following permissions: Disable inheritence -> Remove All and New Permissions -> Everyone -> All.

![ostsample](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87aaf969-5497-4f59-a4eb-2aab1169e37d)
![ostconfig](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92769f26-119a-4a7d-84c0-0ca3a5292cf6)

From the installation files, download and install HeidiSQL. Create a new session with HeidiSQL and enter the password used in the installation of MySQL earlier. Within the new session, right-click on Unnamed and create a new database named osTicket.

![hedisql](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87756bb5-bd2a-421b-b1e9-43257300cb91)
![heidisql2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17818137-1e07-419b-b3eb-6ad8626cc8d7)

Within osTicket browser window, enter the necessary details to set up osTicket. For the MySQL database, use the credentials used for MySQL and HeidiSQL.

![databaeinstall](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3d5b290-9573-4294-82cb-a83d7e9e4643)

After everything is done, osTicket should now be installed! Before continuing to use osTicket, some clean up has to be done. First, delete the setup folder found in C:\inetpub\wwwroot\osTicket. Next, return to C:\inetpub\wwwroot\osTicket\include and change the permissions of the ost-config.php file. The file should no longer have full access to Everyone. Revert the permissions to "Read" only.

![osinstall](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f1d334f-995e-448e-8428-718a1e07cecb)

<h2>osTicket Installed!</h2>

osTicket is now installed and ready to be used. I used osTicket to understand how ticketing systems work and how to resolve tickets. In IT Support, I have to work with a team to solve a person's IT related issues through the use of a ticketing system. I used this lab as a means to set up a ticketing system from the ground up and lay the grounds for what I will do in the future.

<h1>Active Directory Configurations</h1>
In this lab I will now be configuring Active Directory and allowing a client to join the domain as well as creating user accounts.
<br />

<h2>Environment and Technologies Used</h2>

- <b>Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)</b>
- <b>Remote Desktop</b>
- <b>Active Directory Domain Services</b>
- <b>PowerShell</b>

<h2>Operating Systems Used</h2>

- <b>Windows Server 2022</b>
- <b>Windows 10 Pro</b>

<h2>Deployment and Configuration</h2>

In this lab I create two VMs in the same VNET. One will be a Domain Controller, the other will be a Client machine. I change the DC to a static IP because its offering Active Directory services to the client machine. Client machine will be joined to the domain. This will control the DNS settings on the client machine, the client machine will use the DC as its DNS server.

![configuration](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e432df2-d8f4-4334-afbf-95750552d756)

DC-1 has to have a static Private IP Address. Client one will connect to DC-1 to ensure connectivity I will try to ping DC-1 from Client-1. At first the ping will not work correctly. I have to enable ICMPv4 on the firewall on DC-1. Now I can ping DC-1 successfully from Client-1

![windows defender](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01936776-13a3-4268-99f4-44fbd504843d)
![admin command prompt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1a80449a-ecd6-43e7-827d-20c64317893a)

Now I will log back into DC-1 to install AD Users & Computers. Promote the VM to DC, setup a new forest as "mydomain.com" afterwards restart then log back into DC-1 as user: "mydomain.com\labuser". Now I should be able to run AD Users & Computers as shown below.

![mydomain](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8aa88b2e-7646-4fe2-9a24-fa1c2c50e70e)

I start creating Organizational Units (OU). First an OU named _EMPLOYEES. Another OU named _ADMINS. Then created a user named Jane Doe, she is going to be an Admin so her username will be Jane_admin. Lastly added Jane to the domain admins security group.

![janedoe1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1098f866-a051-4df8-8000-3596f69f3ac1)
![janedoe2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a1ccd76-a871-4a48-8606-2e148dadb164)

Now I can use Jane_admin as the administrator account. Now I will join Client-1 to the domain (mydomain.com) from the azure portal I will change client-1's DNS settings to the DC's Private IP address. After that, restart Client-1 from within the Azure portal. Picture below shows verification that client-1 is on the DC-1 DNS.

![dns servers](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/545ce952-b0e0-429c-8751-46016ec1555e)
![command dns line](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/780e98e7-f4f7-42a0-b8ca-d63f455ea7d3)

Join Client-1 to the domain in order to do so navigate to system settings and go to about. Off to the right select rename this pc (advanced). From there select to change the domain. Enter "mydomain.com" after that enter credentials from mydomain.com\labuser. Computer will restart and then client-1 will be a part of mydomain.com.

![mydomain client 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b3f1c11-7834-47d8-be20-c4cbb2f56fdb)

Client-1 is now a part of the domain. Now I will set up remote desktop for non-administrative users on Client-1. I have to log into Client-1 as an admin and open system properties. Click on "Remote Desktop", allow "domain users" access to remote desktop. After completing those steps I should be able to log into Client-1 as a normal user.

![mydomain users](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d93ba380-086f-4ed9-b646-79560eee042e)

Lastly to verify that normal users can RDP into Client-1 I will use a script to generate thousands of users into the domain. I will input the script in powershell, after the users are created I will select one and RDP into Client-1.

![rdp client 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b81133f0-dac6-4acf-aa6e-b6605aa09081)
![domain users](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9cb038a-bde7-405f-a449-6e1d9532b661)
![command line users](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f09a84de-1a01-436d-bdd1-b6691de06b70)

The Powershell script created a user with the username "bab.hubo" I am now able to login to Client-1 with his credentials as a normal user.

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

Through this lab, I learned how to configure Active Directory from scratch, including promoting a VM to a domain controller, creating a new forest, and joining a client machine to the domain. I gained experience managing DNS settings, enabling firewall rules, creating users and organizational units, and allowing Remote Desktop access for domain users. I also practiced automation by generating user accounts with PowerShell.

<h1>Inspecting Network Protocols & Network Security Groups (NSGs)</h1>
In this lab, I observe various network traffics to and from Azure Virtual Machines with Wireshark as well as experiment with network security groups.
<br />

<h2>Environment and Technologies Used</h2>

- <b>Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)</b>
- <b>Remote Desktop Connection</b>
- <b>Command-Line Tools</b>
- <b>Various Network Protocols (SSH, RDH, DNS, HTTP/S, ICMP)</b>
- <b>Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)</b>

<h2>Operating Systems Used</h2>

- <b>Windows 10 Pro</b>
- <b>Ubuntu Server 20.04</b>

<h2>The Set-Up</h2>
Within Azure, I created two VMs within the same virtual network to ensure they are able to communicate with each other. One VM will have Windows 10 Pro while the other uses Ubuntu. The Windows VM will connect to the other via the command line/Powershell

<h2>Actions and Observations</h2>

Using Remote Desktop Connection, I connect to the Windows VM using its public IP address. From there, I installed Wireshark in order to begin inspecting traffic.

![rd1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f095fc03-68ed-4765-8c24-40e0f98bea76)

Within Wireshark, I filtered for ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) traffic and opened PowerShell to execute a command called ping. Ping utilizes ICMP, which is used by devices in a network to communicate problems within data transmition. I used ping to see if I can communicate with the Ubuntu VM using its private IP address and with google.com. Afterwards, I used a perpetual ping to the Ubuntu VM in order to see how network security groups work. I executed the perpetual ping with the command: ping -t (ip address).

![rd2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bb3d9b4-e8cb-43e2-a141-19485ba5c69f)

Within the Azure portal, I opened the networking settings for the Ubuntu VM and added an inbound security rule to block ICMP traffic. I make sure to have the priority higher than SSH (300) to ensure the rule applies first.

![network setting](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06f6d67b-6a73-47fa-98d2-fdf7a25543bf)

Upon returning to the Windows VM, I notice that the ICMP traffic is blocked now that the inbound security rule is in place. After changing the rule to allow traffic again, the perpetual ping resolves without timing out.

![icmp](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5269ccd7-6792-412c-a61d-34480dc61bea)

Next, I chose to examine SSH traffic. I logged in to the Ubuntu server via PowerShell with the ssh command. With Wireshark, I filtered the traffic with tcp.port == 22. While logged into the Ubuntu server, my session is logged in Wireshark with each command I use.

![ssh](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c7915ae-80cf-4825-8da4-71763865653e)

After examining SSH traffic, I exited the Ubuntu server in order to filter for DHCP traffic. To see it in action, I decided to attempt to issue a new IP address from my VM. The command ipconfig /renew will attempt to issue the new IP address and will temporarily disconnect me for a few seconds. After reconnecting, the resulting traffic is shown in Wireshark.

![dhcp](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee17eb6b-8dea-4b53-81b7-0388554b7f88)

To observe DNS traffic, I used the filter udp.port == 53 and the command nslookup. I wanted to see the results that are from looking up google.com and disney.com, two very popular sites.

![udp port 53](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e16455a0-8ee6-4484-b49e-926c7d2085b2)

To finish my lab, I decided to observe RDP traffic. The filter for Wireshark is tcp.port == 3389. There is non-stop traffic because RDP is constantly showing me a live stream from one computer to another (in my case, my computer accessing the VM that is hosted on Azure) and thus traffic is always transmitted.

![tcp 3389](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dfd1d8ec-670f-4245-a12e-a3312f26a990)

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
This project strengthened my understanding of cloud networking and security by configuring Azure NSGs and analyzing real-time traffic with Wireshark. I gained hands-on experience with key protocols (ICMP, SSH, DNS, DHCP, RDP) and learned how security rules impact network communication. It also improved my troubleshooting skills through protocol filtering and traffic analysis.
